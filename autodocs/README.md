## Getting Started

The docs were autogenerated using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). Navigate to `build/html/index.html` to read the docs.



## Installation

```django
conda install -c anaconda sphinx
pip install rinohtype
```



## How To

Autodocs were generated using Sphinx following [this guide](https://medium.com/@richdayandnight/a-simple-tutorial-on-how-to-document-your-python-project-using-sphinx-and-rinohtype-177c22a15b5b).

```django
sphinx-quickstart

> Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: y
> Project name: wallymart
> Author name(s): harrisonized
> Project release []: 1.0
> Project language [en]: 
```

After setting up the `source/index.rst` and  `source/api.rst` , use  `make html` to generate the docs.
